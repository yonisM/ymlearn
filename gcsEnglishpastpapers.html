            <p class = "text-center"><u><strong>Paper 1: Explorations in creative reading and writing</strong></u></p>
            <span> The source for the reading questions will be a literature fiction text. It will be drawn from either the 20th or 21st century. Its genre will be prose fiction. It will include extracts from novels and short stories and focus on openings, endings, narrative perspectives and points of view, narrative or descriptive passages, character, atmospheric descriptions and other appropriate narrative and descriptive approaches.
            As a stimulus for students’ own writing, there will be a choice of scenario, written prompt or visual image that is related to the topic of the reading text in section A. The scenario sets out a context for writing with a designated audience, purpose and form that will differ to those specified on Paper 2. The aim of this paper is to engage students in a creative text and inspire them to write creatively themselves: </span><br><br>
                
                
        
            <span><u>Section A</u></span><br>
            <span> Section A involves reading a literature fiction text in order to consider how established writers use narrative and descriptive techniques to capture the interest of readers</span>
                <span>1 short form question (1 x 4 marks)</span><br>
                <span>2 longer form questions (2 x 8 marks)</span><br>
                <span>1 extended question (1 x 20 marks)</span><br><br>
            
            <span><u>Section B</u></span><br>
                <span>Section B involves writing their own creative text, inspired by the topic that they have responded to in section A to demonstrate their narrative and descriptive skills in response to a written prompt, scenario or visual image.</span>
                <span>1 extended writing question (24 marks for content, 16 marks for technical accuracy)</span><br>
                <span> Total Marks for Paper 1 = <strong>80 Marks</strong></span><br><br>
                
                
            <span>The paper will assess in this sequence, AO1, AO2 and AO4 for reading, and AO5 and AO6 for writing. Section A will be allocated 40 marks, and Section B will be allocated 40 marks to give an equal weighting to the reading and writing tasks.</span>

           <p class = "text-center"><u><strong>Paper 2: Writers’ viewpoints and perspectives </strong></u></p>
               <span>The sources for the reading questions will be non-fiction and literary non-fiction texts. They will be drawn from the 19th century, and either the 20th or 21st century depending on the time period assessed in Paper 1 in each particular series. The combination selected will always provide students with an opportunity to consider viewpoints and perspectives over time. Choice of genre will include high quality journalism, articles, reports, essays, travel writing, accounts, sketches, letters, diaries, autobiography and biographical passages or other appropriate non-fiction and literary non-fiction forms.
In section B, there will be a single writing task related to the theme of section A. It will specify audience, purpose and form, and will use a range of opinions, statements and writing scenarios to provoke a response. The aim of this paper is to develop students’ insights into how writers have particular viewpoints and perspectives on issues or themes that are important to the way we think and live our lives</span><br><br>
